# B.N.C.E ~ Bell Nozzle Contour Evaluator

This project is in association with the Kingston University's Rocket Propulsion Group/ Formula Rocket Team. It was initially created for use in the design of a hybrid engine for space port america cup 2021. 

## Authors:
- * Vinay Williams (2020)
- * Mohammed Zweiri (2020)
